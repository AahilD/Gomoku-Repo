# Gomoku

# Instructions

Once you have imported this application into Eclipse, (for now) run the application from StartGameForm.Java.
The player registration form window will appear and prompt the user's to enter a username. For now, the game is a 2-Player game with no option to play against the computer. The option to play against the computer will come in a future iteration once the 2-Player version is working properly.
